# Typero

This app is useful to test/measure the typing speed of a user and accuracy.Statistically speaking, the average speed is about 41 words / minute (205 characters / minute). 
I created an application in C ++, which generates on the screen sequences of characters necessary for practice and records the correctness and speed of typing. As an additional function, the application produces exercises adapted to each user according to the most wrong character typed.
